## 📖 Introduction

**reBot-DevArm (reBot Arm B601 DM and reBot Arm B601 RS)** is a robotic arm project dedicated to lowering the barrier to learning Embodied AI. We focus on **"True Open Source"** — not just the code, we unreservedly open source everything:
- 🦾 **Two versions of the robotic arm**：We will provide all open-source files for two versions of the robotic arm with the same appearance: **Robostride** and **Damiao**.
- 🛠️ **Hardware Blueprints**: Source files for sheet metal parts and 3D printed parts.
- 🔩 **BOM List**: Detailed down to the specifications and purchase links for every single screw.
- 💻 **Software & Algorithms**: Python SDK, ROS1/2, Isaac Sim, LeRobot, etc.

## Build Your Own reBot Arm

- We offer five kit options:
  - **Arm Body Motor Kit**: Includes only motors and wiring harnesses for the robotic arm.
  - **Arm Body Structural Kit**: Includes only mechanical structural components.
  - **Gripper Complete Kit**: Includes motors, wiring harnesses and structural components for the gripper.
  - **Full Kit**: Includes the complete set of the robotic arm body and gripper.

#### (2) Prohibited Commercial Activities

It is prohibited to make minor modifications to this project’s product, replace IP, logos, or related identifiers, and sell it under a self-owned brand. Such actions do not constitute substantial technical innovation and do not benefit developer growth, the open-source community, or the project itself. These behaviors are considered violations, and we reserve the right to take action.

### III. Collaboration & Contact

We hope to collaborate with all developers and partners within a compliant framework to promote the maturity and deployment of the reBot robotic arm project. For individuals and organizations interested in bringing real-world robotic applications to life, we offer:
